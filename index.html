  <h3 class="lj">Getting To Know Leah</h3>
  <p class="lj">Leah takes great pride in her aspirations, when asked to look 5 years into the future, she says she envisions herself as an editorial stylist.</p>
  <p class="lj">Taking big inspiration from Anna Wintour and Anok Yai, she takes strides into following their footsteps and entering the fashion world.
  As a child, Leah took sewing lessons and quickly realized that designing clothes was not aligning with what she wanted for herself, instead she realized she wanted to be in charge of the next step---the styling.
  Working for companies like Vouge, Jaquemus, and Diesel would be achieving her ultimate goal. She plans to attend FIT in New York to study fashion business management</p>
